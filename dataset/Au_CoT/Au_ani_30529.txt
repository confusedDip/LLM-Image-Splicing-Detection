Let’s think step by step. The image depicts an otter in its natural habitat, holding and eating a fish. The surroundings—including the water body in the background and the greenery around the otter—appear natural and consistent with the scene. The otter blends seamlessly into its environment, with no elements that seem visually out of place. The relationship between the objects, such as the otter and the fish, appears realistic in terms of scale, positioning, and color. Lighting, shadows, and reflections are consistent across the image. Additionally, the edges and contours are smooth and continuous, with no abrupt transitions or unnatural texture boundaries. Based on these observations, the image shows no signs of manipulation. Therefore, it is Authentic.
