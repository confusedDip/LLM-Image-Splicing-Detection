Letâ€™s think step by step. The image depicts a tall monumental column standing in the center of a spacious, European-style city square. The architectural style of the surrounding buildings is consistent with classical European design, featuring ornate windows, mansard roofs, and uniform facades. The lighting and shadows across the scene are consistent, falling naturally in alignment with the position of the sun. The monument, buildings, street lamps, and vehicles in the background all exhibit proper scale, perspective, and integration. There are no signs of abrupt transitions, mismatched edges, or inconsistencies in texture, lighting, or color tones across different parts of the image. All elements appear naturally composed and semantically coherent within the context of a historical public square. Therefore, the image is classified as Authentic.
