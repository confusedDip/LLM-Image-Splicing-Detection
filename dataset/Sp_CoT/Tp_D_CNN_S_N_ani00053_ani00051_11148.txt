Let’s think step by step. The image captures three animals in what appears to be a natural habitat. At the center, a snake is shown hunting a frog—an interaction that aligns naturally with predator-prey relationships in the food chain. However, the presence of a lizard in the same frame seems unusual and out of context. Notably, parts of the lizard appear to be touching the snake in an unnatural way, raising questions about spatial coherence. Contextually, the lizard would also be considered prey for the snake and has no logical connection to the frog in this scene, making its inclusion questionable. Furthermore, there are noticeable inconsistencies in lighting, shadows, and reflections specifically on the lizard, which are not aligned with the rest of the image. These visual and contextual discrepancies strongly suggest that the lizard was digitally inserted from another source. Therefore, the image is classified as Spliced.
