Let’s think step by step. The image shows a traditional building with tourists walking nearby. The people, structure, and lighting all appear natural and consistent. However, the signboard with four Chinese characters at the top looks out of place. The characters don’t blend well, the lighting and texture differ from the rest of the image, and there are no shadows or depth suggesting physical presence. These inconsistencies indicate the sign was digitally added. Therefore, the image is classified as Spliced.
