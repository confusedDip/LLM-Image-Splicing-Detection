Letâ€™s think step by step. The image shows a dry grass field enclosed by a fence, with distant buildings in the background. The lighting, textures, and elements like the fence and vegetation appear naturally consistent. However, the tiled path running across the center looks unnatural. Its edges are overly sharp, it lacks blending with the grass, and no shadows or transition zones are visible. Additionally, it's contextually odd to see a clean, tiled walkway placed in the middle of an otherwise untended, dry grass field. This mismatch in both visual integration and environmental logic suggests that the path was digitally inserted. Therefore, the image is classified as Spliced.
