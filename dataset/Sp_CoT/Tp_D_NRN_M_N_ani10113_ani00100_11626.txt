Letâ€™s think step by step. The image shows a close-up of a rough concrete surface with two large ants walking naturally on it. The texture, scale, and lighting on the ants appear consistent with the background. However, the rooster stands out as visually and contextually out of place. Its size is disproportionately small relative to the ants, which defies natural scale. Additionally, the lighting and shadows on the rooster do not align with those in the rest of the scene, and its edges appear too sharp and clean compared to the surrounding surface. The overall composition suggests that the rooster was digitally inserted. Therefore, the image is classified as Spliced.
