Let’s think step by step. The image shows a scenic riverside view with a large historical building in the background, a boat on the right, and tree branches framing the top. The lighting, color tones, and reflections across the architecture, water, and environment appear consistent and natural. However, the person on a paddleboard in the foreground appears out of place. The lighting on the paddleboarder doesn't match the warm golden tones of the background scene, and the cutout edges around the figure and the board are too sharp. Additionally, the scale and positioning on the water feel unnatural—there are no ripples or reflections indicating physical presence in the scene. These visual mismatches suggest that the paddleboarder was digitally inserted. Therefore, the image is classified as Spliced.
